## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project using an API. After struggling with Next.js, I decided to go with vanilla JS. I'll try using Next.js in the next project. If you're gonna try this by yourself, remember the `cache: "no-cache"` on the `fetch()`.

### Continued development

Maybe I'll remake it with Next.js.
